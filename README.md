# p5js NACO-visualizer (NaturalComputing)
This is a simple function optimization visualizer. It uses Genetic Algorithm and Particle Swarm optimization. 
The function is represented as a grid color map with discrete domain. 
The program was tested with functions taken from here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_functions_for_optimization

You can test either GA or PSO by clicking "new population" and then watch the steps taken to reach the optimal value by clicking "next step" button.
